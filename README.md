# McDonalds-Nutrition-Dataset
I'm pretty sure we've all eaten something from the McDonalds menu and most of us have complained about the broken ice cream machines. This Dataset includes all major McDonalds menu items listed with their menu categories and nutritive facts. Now if you want to analyze the quality of food or perform classification of menu types , It's all upto you. I have made a lot of effort to not only manually group the menu items but also included my personal Indian special McAloo Tikki.

Dietary habits have been exponentially worsening for a majority of people these days. A proper analysis of nutrition data and reports would be super helpful in spreading awarness about what people are actually consuming disguised as a tempting burger.
